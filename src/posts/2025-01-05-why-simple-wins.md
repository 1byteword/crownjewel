# Why Simple Wins

*January 5, 2025*

Complexity is easy. Simplicity is hard. The best solutions are often the ones that don't exist yet - the problems you solve by not creating them.

Every dependency is a liability. Every abstraction has a cost. Every line of code must be maintained, debugged, and understood.

The question isn't "what can I add?" It's "what can I remove?"

Simplicity compounds. So does complexity. Choose wisely.
